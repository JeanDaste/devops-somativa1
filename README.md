# Survey Form for FCC
Survey Form
This project is a simple survey form built with HTML and CSS. It collects basic information from users and provides a place for feedback and suggestions. The form includes text inputs, dropdowns, checkboxes, and radio buttons.

# Purpose
This project is part of my study on HTML and CSS to practice building forms and styling them.
